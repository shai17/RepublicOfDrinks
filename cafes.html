                         <h4>Does the word Chemex mean anything to you? How about washed Kenyan cold-drip, or an inverted rosetta-tulip on a single-extracted flat white? If thatâ€™s not gibberish, then Prufrock Coffee will be right up your street. Or up your (Leather) Lane. As well as having a famous address, Prufrock is a spacious, light and bright cafÃ© that serves brunch but specialises in caffeine; coffee beans, coffee merchandise and posters for barista training courses line the walls.
